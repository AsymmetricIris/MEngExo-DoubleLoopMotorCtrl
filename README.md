# MEngExo-DoubleLoopMotorCtrl
Modification to the Parkinson's wrist tremor simulator which uses a motor controller with 2 control loops (position w low gain + voltage w high gain) to simulate power wrist oscillations while approximating the angle the "patient's" wrist is trying to maintain.


![Currently, the position control loop behaves approimately as intended](https://github.com/AsymmetricIris/MEngExo-DoubleLoopMotorCtrl/blob/master/img/pos_ctrl.png?raw=true)
