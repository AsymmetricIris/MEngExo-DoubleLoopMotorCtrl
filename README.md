# MEngExo-DoubleLoopMotorCtrl
Modification to the Parkinson's wrist tremor simulator which uses a motor controller with 2 control loops (position w low gain + voltage w high gain) to simulate power wrist oscillations while approximating the angle the "patient's" wrist is trying to maintain.

Currently, the position control loop behaves approimately as intended
